# MeeshQuestCanonicalTester
Automatically using MeeshQuest Canonical Output from user Input. Runs mutiple tests based upon id. 

External JARs required:
* https://code.google.com/archive/p/java-diff-utils/
* https://jsoup.org/download

Use:
* Copy into cmsc420.utils package
* Add external JARs
* Make folder "testfiles"
* Have MeeshQuest.java read from input in folder
* Run with test startId and endId

I realize this is very "hacky" but it works well and is much faster then doing it manually.
Please feel free to improve. 

WHEN SUBMITTING UNCHECK Tester file. (Submit server does not have the jars)
